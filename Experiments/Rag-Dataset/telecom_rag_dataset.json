    "q": "My bill shows data usage that seems higher than what I actually used. How can I verify this?",
    "a": "Data usage is recorded in real-time by our billing system. Common reasons for apparent discrepancies: 1) Background app updates and syncing consume data 2) Cloud storage automatic backups 3) Social media cached data 4) Device software updates.

  {
    "id": "net_001",
    "category": "Network",
    "q": "Why is my internet speed slower than usual?",
    "a": "Network speed variations can be caused by: 1) Peak usage hours (typically 7-10 PM) 2) Device storage full or RAM issues 3) Signal strength - move closer to window/tower 4) WiFi interference if using WiFi 5) Outdated device. Troubleshooting: Restart device, clear cache, check signal bars (4-5 bars required), test speed at different location."
  },
  {
    "id": "net_002",
    "category": "Network",
    "q": "I have no signal in my area. Is there a network outage?",
    "a": "If you have no signal: 1) Check if airplane mode is enabled 2) Restart your device 3) Check signal bars in Settings 4) Move to open area away from buildings 5) Check our network status page for outages in your postal code. Please provide your location/postal code and we can check for planned maintenance or network issues affecting your area."

  {
    "id": "net_003",
    "category": "Network",
    "q": "My data connection is slow but my calls work fine. Are these issues related?",
    "a": "Data and calling use different network technologies. Data uses LTE/5G while calling uses Circuit Switched network, so they are independent. If only data is slow: 1) Check network type (3G/4G/5G) in settings 2) Toggle WiFi off if connected 3) Restart device 4) Move closer to tower. Slow data doesn't affect call quality."
  },
  {
    "id": "net_004",
    "category": "Network",
    "q": "The signal bars show 4G but my speeds are very slow. Why?",
    "a": "4G signal availability doesn't guarantee 4G speeds. Factors affecting speed: 1) Distance from cell tower - farther distance = slower speed 2) Network congestion during peak hours 3) Device limitations - older devices may not support full 4G capacity 4) Interference from buildings. Signal bars show availability, not speed capacity. Move closer to tower or use WiFi for better speeds."
  },
  {
    "id": "net_005",
    "category": "Network",
    "q": "What should I do if I lose network connection during a call?",
    "a": "If network drops during call: 1) It's usually temporary - signal will reconnect automatically 2) If at cell tower boundary, move to location with stronger signal 3) Check if you're moving between WiFi and mobile network 4) Ensure sufficient balance/active plan. Frequent drops indicate: device issue, weak signal area, or plan expiration. Test connection in different locations."

  {
    "id": "plan_001",
    "category": "Plans",
    "q": "Which plan is best suited for my usage needs?",
    "a": "To recommend the right plan, we need to know: 1) How much data do you use monthly (in GB) 2) How many minutes of calling do you need 3) Do you need international calling 4) Any special requirements (priority network, rollover). Based on 20GB monthly data usage, we recommend: Premium Data Plan (\u20b9699/month with rollover) or Unlimited Plan (\u20b9899/month with priority network). Compare details in portal."
